    "Operators in Computer Science are a tiny bit different from operators in a regular math class. We use `+` and `-`, but for multiplication we use a `*` (instead of an x) and for division we use `\\`. Just like with order of operations, the computer will evaluate anything inside of parenthesis first, followed by multiplication and division, before addition and subtraction. \n",

    "float     | A \"float\" is a floating-point number, aka any number with a \"point\" or decimal \n",
    "boolean   | A boolean is a data type that's always ever True or False\n",
    "string    | A string is a word or series of letters or numbers in quotes, like \"hello\" or \"b4 I go\"\n",
    "  \n",

    "### A few more notes about variables\n",
    "- **camelCase:** camelCase is a computer science convention for how we name variables with multiple words. In the code above, we use camel case with the variable `isLearning` so it's more readable than something like `islearning` (and you can't have spaces in variable names). Some people prefer to put underscores between the words like `is_learning`. It's really a matter of personal style. Either way, making variable names meaningful is a crucial part of a variable's job - so make those names meaningful!\n",
    "- **Case Sensitive:** Python variables are case sensitive, so `helloThere` is not the same as `HelloThere`\n",
    "- **Reserved Keywords:** Python (and all languages) has a list of keywords that the language uses to execute certain commands, therefore things get sticky if we try using them as variable names. Here's a complete list of those key words, make sure you take a look to avoid bugs in your code. https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keywords-identifier\n",
    "- **Data Type Matters:** Sometimes data type matters. To check the data type of your variable you can run it through the `type()` method (try that with some of the variables above - like `type(myFirstVariable)`. \n",
    "- **Printing Mixed Types:** The most common type significant situation we'll be encountering is when we try to `print()` an int/float with a string. Since the computer is expecting one type, we get to convert the int from something like `10` to string form like `\"10\"`. This is super simple, using the handy `str()` string-conversion method and can be seen in the code below. "
