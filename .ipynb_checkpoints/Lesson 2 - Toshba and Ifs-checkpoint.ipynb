There are specific ways of referring to Masechtot, and then you plug that formula between the quotes of code that looks like this: `myMasechet = Ref(' ')`. \n",

    "#### More Specific Examples...\n",
    "Since the Talmud is divided into **Daf** and sub-**Amudim**, Sefaria divides up books in **segments** and **sections**.

Well, `elif` (which is short for else-if) and `else` will *only* execute the code nested beneath it if the previous `if` statement evaluated as false. What does that actually mean? An `elif` will only run if the `if` before it wasn't true, and if the `if` before it was true - then it won't run at all. \n",

    "With our summer example, sometimes both conditions could happen at once (i.e. not just almost 9 Av, but also it's summer break and they're bored), so if we used `elif` and `else`, then once a person selected 9 Av, no other pieces of Torah would be returned because it would assume to skip them. By keeping all of the summer options as `if` statements, then the computer is forced to check for all three even if one evaluates as true. \n",
