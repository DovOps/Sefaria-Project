    "\n",
    "Let's unpack that a little with an example. Let's say we had a friend named Joy who wanted us to use our Sukkah Sensor to help her figure out whether or not her sukkah is kosher. She tells us that her sukkah is 10 amot high, has four walls, has more shade than sun, was built 12 days ago, and she built it with the intent of performing the mitzvah. We could build a chart as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sukkah Part | Value\n",
    "------------|------\n",
    "Name        | Joy's Sukkah\n",

    "Walls       | 4\n",
    "More Sun    | False\n",
    "Age         | 12 days\n",
    "Intent      | Mitzvah\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we plug our values into the `Sukkah()` between the parenthesis (order and quotes **do** matter) and our code would look something like this:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "joys_sukkah = Sukkah(\"Joy's Sukkah\", 10, \"amot\", 4, False, 12, \"mitzvah\")\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "1. Run the code in the cell below. Is the sukkah kosher? Explain. \n",
    "2. Adjust the parameters of the sukkah to change its status, re-run your code to test. \n",
    "3. Use the lines from the Mishnah to explain which parameters you're changing. \n",
    "4. How many different kosher sukkahs can you build? Test by running them through the code. Write down every different configuration for a kosher sukkah you come up with on a piece of paper. "
